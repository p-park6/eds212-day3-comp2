## Vectors in R
```{r}
marmots <- c("blue", "green", 4, "yellow", TRUE)

class(marmots)
#shows it as character since it is the most flexible

marmots
#we see everything as quotes
```
## Create a numeric vector
```{r}
pika <- c(12.4, 6.8, 2.9, 8.9, 5)
class(pika)
#R reads this as numeric class
```
```{r}
bear <- c(20L,3L,5L,18L)
class(bear)
#R reads this as integer value
```
