## Vectors in R
```{r}
marmots <- c("blue", "green", 4, "yellow", TRUE)

class(marmots)
#shows it as character since it is the most flexible

marmots
#we see everything as quotes
```
## Create a numeric vector
```{r}
pika <- c(12.4, 6.8, 2.9, 8.9, 5)
class(pika)
#R reads this as numeric class
```
```{r}
bear <- c(20L,3L,5L,18L)
class(bear)
#R reads this as integer value
```

```{r}
ringtail <- c(1,3,5,7)
fox <- c(2,4,6,8)
ringtail+fox
#this is adding the two vectors to make a new vector
ringtain_fox <- ringtail+fox
#this is storing the new vector to a name (if this was by itself, the code would not show up. it would be stored)
ringtail_minus_fox <- ringtail-fox
#again, same thing applies to here with what happened for the addition scenario

## Scalar multiplier
100*ringtail
# Dot product
ringtail %*% fox
```
